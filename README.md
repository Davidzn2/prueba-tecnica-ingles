# Frontend Developer Challenge

### Take-Home Assignment

## Description

With this exercise, we will evaluate your ability to develop a simple frontend application that meets the requirements for an imaginary product we want to build.

Completing this should take you anywhere from a couple of hours to up to a day depending on your level of expertise, available time to focus, and level of detail you consider sufficient.

That said, if it is taking you more than a day, you are probably spending more effort than necessary in some details.
We expect that you submit your final work within one week of receiving the assignment, but please let us know if this is too short notice for you.

Please feel free to reach out and ask questions if you need any clarification.

## Details

### The Application

We are very enthusiastic about Crypto! We would like to have a site to view the top 50 Cryptos based on Market Cap. In the first part of this project, we would like to see a list of the 50 best cryptos, and we want to be able to filter them by:

1. Name
2. Price
3. Market Cap
4. Circulating Supply (For example, Bitcoin Max supply is 21 Million Bitcoins, but the circulating supply is approx. 18 million)

## Requirements

As we said before, it can take you a couple of hours or a day.

1. You can use [this api endpoint](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=50&page=1&sparkline=false) or any other API (just try to complete the requirements)
2. Use Hooks
3. Refactor the code
4. Format values (dates, prices, etc)
5. Use Bootstrap or any other CSS Framework

## How to deliver

1. Create a React App with a new project
2. Deploy this app (you can use Vercel, Github Pages, Netlify or whaterver you want)
